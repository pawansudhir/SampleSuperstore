### Exploratory data analysis

This repository contains the given csv file. I have converted the csv format into xlsxformat, the data range was converted to table on which filter is applied on the profit column to get the rows where the business has made losses.
There is also a superStoreDashboard.pbix file which is a power bi file containing the dashboard representing the dataset.
